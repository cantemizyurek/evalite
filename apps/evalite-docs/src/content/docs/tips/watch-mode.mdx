title: Watch Mode
---

Watch mode re-runs evals when files change, making iteration fast during development.

## Start Watch Mode

```bash
evalite watch
```

This watches `.eval.ts` files and re-runs them on changes.

## Hide Table Output

When debugging with `console.log`, hide the detailed table to see logs clearly:

```bash
evalite watch --hideTable
```

Keeps score summary but removes the detailed results table.

## Serve Mode Alternative

Run evals once and serve UI without re-running on file changes:

```bash
evalite serve
```

Runs evals once, keeps UI at `http://localhost:3006`. Tests won't re-run on file changes.

To re-run after changes, restart `evalite serve`.

Useful when evals take a long time to run.
