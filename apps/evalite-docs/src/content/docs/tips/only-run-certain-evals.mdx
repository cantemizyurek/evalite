title: Only Run Certain Evals
---

Skip entire evals or focus on specific test cases during development.

## Skip Entire Evals

Use `evalite.skip()` to skip an entire eval without running it.

```ts
evalite.skip("My Eval", {
  data: () => [],
  task: () => {},
});
```

This is useful when you want to temporarily disable an eval during development or testing.

## Focus on Specific Test Cases

Use the `only` flag on data entries to focus on specific inputs during development.

```ts
evalite("My Eval", {
  data: () => [
    { input: "test1", expected: "output1" },
    { input: "test2", expected: "output2", only: true },
    { input: "test3", expected: "output3" },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    // Only runs for "test2"
  },
});
```

When any data entry has `only: true`, only those evals will be run.

## Run Specific Files

Run specific eval files instead of all evals by passing file paths as arguments.

```bash
evalite my-eval.eval.ts
```

Run multiple files:

```bash
evalite eval1.eval.ts eval2.eval.ts
```

Works with `watch` and `serve` modes:

```bash
evalite watch my-eval.eval.ts
evalite serve my-eval.eval.ts
```

This is useful when working on a specific eval and you don't want to run the entire test suite.
