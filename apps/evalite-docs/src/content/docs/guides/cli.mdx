## Watch Mode

You can run Evalite in watch mode by running `evalite watch`:

```bash
evalite watch
```

This will watch for changes to your `.eval.ts` files and re-run the evals when they change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> I strongly recommend implementing a caching layer in your LLM calls when using watch mode. This will keep your evals running fast and avoid burning through your API credits.

### Hiding the Table Output

When debugging with `console.log`, the detailed table output can make it harder to see your logs. You can hide it with `--hideTable`:

```bash
evalite watch --hideTable
```

This keeps the score summary but removes the detailed results table from the CLI output.

## Serve Mode

You can run evals once and serve the UI without re-running on file changes:

```bash
evalite serve
```

This runs your evals once and keeps the UI server running at `http://localhost:3006`. Unlike watch mode, tests won't re-run when files change.

Since evals can take a while to run, this can be a useful alternative to watch mode.

To re-run evals after making changes, restart `evalite serve`.

## Running Specific Files

You can run specific files by passing them as arguments:

```bash
evalite my-eval.eval.ts
```

This also works for `watch` and `serve` modes:

```bash
evalite watch my-eval.eval.ts
evalite serve my-eval.eval.ts
```

## Threshold

You can tell Evalite that your evals must pass a specific score by passing `--threshold`:

```bash
evalite --threshold=50 # Score must be greater than or equal to 50

evalite watch --threshold=70 # Also works in watch mode
```

This is useful for running on CI. If the score threshold is not met, it will fail the process.

## Export Command

Export eval results as a static HTML bundle:

```bash
evalite export
```

This exports the latest run to `./evalite-export` by default.

See the [CI/CD guide](/guides/ci) for full documentation on exporting and viewing static UI bundles.
