title: Skipping Evals

## Skipping Entire Evals

You can use `evalite.skip()` to skip an entire eval without running it.

```ts
evalite.skip("My Eval", {
  data: () => [],
  task: () => {},
});
```

This is useful when you want to temporarily disable an eval during development or testing.

## Focusing on Specific Evals

You can use the `only` flag on data entries to focus on specific inputs during development.

```ts
evalite("My Eval", {
  data: () => [
    { input: "test1", expected: "output1" },
    { input: "test2", expected: "output2", only: true },
    { input: "test3", expected: "output3" },
  ],
  task: async (input) => {
    // Only runs for "test2"
  },
});
```

When any data entry has `only: true`, only those evals will be run.
