To call your LLM from a third-party service, you'll likely need some environment variables to keep your API keys safe.

## Setting Up Env Variables

Evalite automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files in your project root. No configuration needed!

<Steps>

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

   ```
   // .env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

2. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`, if it's not already there

   ```
   // .gitignore
   .env
   ```

</Steps>

Now, your environment variables will be available in your evals.

## How It Works

Evalite uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) under the hood to automatically load environment variables from `.env` files. The following files are supported (in order of precedence):

- `.env.local`
- `.env.[mode].local`
- `.env.[mode]`
- `.env`

This happens automaticallyâ€”no setup required!
