title: Running Programmatically
---

You can run Evalite programmatically using the Node API. This is useful when you want to integrate Evalite into your own scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or custom tooling.

## Basic Usage

Import the `runEvalite` function from `evalite/runner`:

```typescript
import { runEvalite } from "evalite/runner";

await runEvalite({
  path: undefined, // Optional: filter to specific files
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  mode: "run-once-and-exit",
});
```

## Run Modes

### Run Once and Exit

This mode runs all evals once and exits. It's ideal for CI/CD pipelines:

```typescript
await runEvalite({
  path: undefined,
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  mode: "run-once-and-exit",
});
```

### Watch Mode

This mode watches for file changes and re-runs evals automatically. It also starts the Evalite UI server:

```typescript
await runEvalite({
  path: undefined,
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  mode: "watch-for-file-changes",
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> I strongly recommend implementing a caching layer in your LLM calls when using watch mode. This will keep your evals running fast and avoid burning through your API credits.

## Options

### `path`

Optional path filter to run specific eval files:

```typescript
await runEvalite({
  path: "my-eval.eval.ts",
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  mode: "run-once-and-exit",
});
```

### `cwd`

The working directory to run evals from. Defaults to the current directory:

```typescript
await runEvalite({
  path: undefined,
  cwd: "/path/to/my/project",
  mode: "run-once-and-exit",
});
```

### `scoreThreshold`

Set a minimum score threshold (0-100). If the average score falls below this threshold, the process will exit with a non-zero exit code:

```typescript
await runEvalite({
  path: undefined,
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  mode: "run-once-and-exit",
  scoreThreshold: 80, // Fail if score is below 80
});
```

This is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines where you want to fail the build if evals don't meet a quality threshold.

### `outputPath`

Export the results to a JSON file after the run completes:

```typescript
await runEvalite({
  path: undefined,
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  mode: "run-once-and-exit",
  outputPath: "./results.json",
});
```

The exported JSON file contains the complete run data including all evals, results, scores, and traces.

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that combines multiple options:

```typescript
import { runEvalite } from "evalite/runner";

async function runEvals() {
  try {
    await runEvalite({
      path: undefined, // Run all evals
      cwd: process.cwd(),
      mode: "run-once-and-exit",
      scoreThreshold: 75, // Fail if average score < 75
      outputPath: "./evalite-results.json", // Export results
    });
    console.log("All evals passed!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Evals failed:", error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

runEvals();
```
