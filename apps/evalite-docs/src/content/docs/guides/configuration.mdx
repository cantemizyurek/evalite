Since **Evalite is based on Vitest**, you can configure eval behavior using Vitest's configuration options. Each data point in your eval becomes a separate Vitest test case, which means all Vitest configuration options work with Evalite.

## Basic Configuration

<Steps>

1. Create a `vitest.config.ts` file in your project root (or update it if it already exists):

   ```ts
   // vitest.config.ts

   import { defineConfig } from "vitest";

   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       // Your configuration here
     },
   });
   ```

2. Run your evals as usual:

   ```bash
   evalite
   ```

   Or in watch mode:

   ```bash
   evalite watch
   ```

</Steps>

## Important Configuration Options

### `maxConcurrency`

Control how many test cases run in parallel. By default, Vitest has a [concurrency limit of 5](https://vitest.dev/config/#maxconcurrency).

For large datasets, increase this to run more tests in parallel:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    maxConcurrency: 100, // Run up to 100 tests in parallel
  },
});
```

This is useful for optimizing performance and managing API rate limits.

### `testTimeout`

Set the maximum time (in milliseconds) a test can run before timing out. Default is 5000ms.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    testTimeout: 30000, // 30 seconds
  },
});
```

For more Vitest configuration options, see the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/config/).
